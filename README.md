# movie_recommendation_engine
This Python Project is regarding the Algorithms and the sub-topic covers the [Movie Recommender] which is built based on Machine Learning and Deep Learning. My project helps the users by giving the Movie predictions based on their Taste and choice. This project is built with algorithms that allow the ML model to predict the Movies in 3 different ways which are as follows:
(1) Popularity
(2) Content-based Filtering Approach
(3) Collaborative-based Filtering Approach
